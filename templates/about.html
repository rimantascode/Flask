  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
  when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an
  adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo
  to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
  force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the
      mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other
      Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in
      TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This
      was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA
      2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
      Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken
      tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

    <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their
      mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and
      great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long
      nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
      joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
      would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his
      brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the
      Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and
      later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The
      Company of Thorin.

    <h3>Glóin</h3>
    <p>
      In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar,
      the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and
      his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the
      Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely
      Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was
      noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin,
      was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made
      camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.[1] After the
      battle, he returned to the Lonely Mountain.

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
      Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the
      dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those
      driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
      Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in
      the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of
      Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
      Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the
      Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

    <h3>Dwalin</h3>
    <p>
      Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor,
      Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain
      the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern
      Ered Luin. Lßater in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a
      few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor.
      The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin
      was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the
      eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their
      leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

   <h3>Ori</h3>
    <p>
      Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of the Five Armies, and he survived it.

  <h3>Dori</h3>
    <p>
    Before The Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's home in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori. In TA 2941, Dori and his two brothers became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

     <h3>Nori</h3>
    <p>
  Nori was the brother of Dori and Ori. Both Nori and Dori were capable flutists, and seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both these apparent brothers also shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

    <h3>Bifur</h3>
    <p>
  Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

    <h3>Bofur</h3>
    <p>
 Bofur was a descendant of the Dwarves of Rhudaur, but was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.[citation needed]

   <h3>Bombur</h3>
    <p>
 Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.
